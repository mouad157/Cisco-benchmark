Same-layer interactions only apply to error recovery features, while adjacent-layer interactions only apply to data encapsulation.']","Which of the following statements best compares same-layer interactions and adjacent-layer interactions in the TCP/IP model?"
"KT_TYPEMCQP_Interpretation","Same-layer vs. adjacent-layer interactions","['C']","['A. The data-link layers on both devices renegotiate IP addressing to correct lost packets.', 'B. The application-layer protocol takes complete responsibility for detecting dropped segments and reinitiates the connection.', 'C. The transport layers on both devices use shared fields, such as sequence numbers, to identify and recover missing data.', 'D. The physical layers exchange electrical signals to alert each other of any lost segments.']","When a web server resends a lost segment to a client over TCP, which statement best interprets how same-layer interaction ensures reliable data delivery?"
"KT_TYPEMCQP_Causal antecedent","Same-layer vs. adjacent-layer interactions","['A']","['A. The higher-layer protocol detects missing or corrupted data, prompting it to use the lower layer for error recovery.', 'B. The user types in a web address, triggering re-transmission of the entire packet stream.', 'C. The data-link layer automatically fixes all errors without informing the higher layer.', 'D. The application layer rejects the TCP headers to reduce overhead.']","In the context of same-layer versus adjacent-layer interactions, what causes a higher-layer protocol to request error recovery from the next-lower-layer protocol, and why?"
"KT_TYPEMCQP_Causal consequence","Same-layer vs. adjacent-layer interactions","['B']","['A. The data is seamlessly retransmitted by the data-link layer.', 'B. The destination host’s network layer never receives the packet, preventing higher layers from processing the data.', 'C. The adjacent layer interaction automatically recovers the lost packet at the router.', 'D. The packet is forwarded anyway after a short delay.']","During a TCP/IP data exchange involving same-layer interactions, what is the direct consequence if an IP packet is discarded by an intermediate router before reaching the destination host?"
